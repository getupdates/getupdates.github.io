## Get Updates on COVID-19

[Get Updates on COVID-19](https://www.canada.ca/en/managed-web-service/get-updates-covid-19.html) is a web-based email service from the Government of Canada that was launched in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Canada. Developed by Health Canada, the Canadian Digital Service, and Service Canada, subscribers to the service get emails directing them to important and authoritative content on the Government of Canada’s [COVID-19 website](https://www.canada.ca/coronavirus).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
